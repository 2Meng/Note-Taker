# Note-Taker

Note-Taker
Description
I wanted to create a simple note taking application that allows users to create or delete notes. When a note is selected to be added or deleted, it is added or removed from the database. In building this project, I learned how to connect basic databases to the front end.

USER STORY AS A small business owner I WANT to be able to write and save notes SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA GIVEN a note-taking application WHEN I open the Note Taker THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page WHEN I click on the link to the notes page THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page WHEN I click on the Save icon THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column THEN that note appears in the right-hand column WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
